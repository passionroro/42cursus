# libft
This first project as a student of 42 will make you consolidate your knowledge of the pool. You will recode a number of functions from the standard C library, as well as other utility functions that you will reuse throughout your course.

## Try it!
First, use `git` to clone my libft into the directory of your choice. 
`	git clone https://github.com/passionroro/42lausanne.git`

Next, `cd` (_change directory_) into 42lausanne/00/libft.
    `cd 42lausanne/00/libft`
  
You can now either: 
 - use the command `make` to compile all the files
 - make your own tests for each function (_pretty tedious for this project in my opinion, but very useful to understand how the functions work_)
 - clone a tester from a third party
Many testers are available : [libftTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester), [libft-unit-tester](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test), [Libftdestructor](https://github.com/t0mm4rx/libftdestructor), [FT_SPLIT_TESTER](https://github.com/Ysoroko/FT_SPLIT_TESTER)...
To run these tests, please refer to the GitHub page of their creator :)

Enjoy !
