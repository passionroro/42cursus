# My school projects !

Hi, I'm Romain! I'm a young student in computer science at **42lausanne**, a programming school opened in 2021 in Lausanne (Switzerland). 
This GitHub gathers all the projects I did, in order, with the grade I got. 
Feel free to have a look at my code, but please be indulgent, it's the first time I code :)
