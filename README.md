# My school projects !

Hi, I'm Romain! I'm a young student in computer science at **42lausanne**, a programming school opened in 2021 in Lausanne (Switzerland). 
This GitHub gathers all the projects I did, in order, with the grade I got. 
Feel free to have a look at my code, but please be indulgent, it's the first time I code :)

## What are these projects ?

At School 42, we learn by project, with no teachers, no classes, and no schedule. 
The projects you see above are ordered from the easiest to the most difficult, they are kind like our "classes". It is thanks to these projects that we learn the essential notions of programming :)
I made the choice to detail only the projects that I think are important to the curriculum, but if you have any question about a project, don't hesitate to contact me !
